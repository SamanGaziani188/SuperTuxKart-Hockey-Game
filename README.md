# SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey Strategy Research

This repository contains the research conducted by Ashima Arora, Colin Fish, Saman Gaziani, and Imran Qureshi from the University of Texas at Austin's Computer Science Department. The research focuses on developing a vision-based agent for SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey that can outperform state-based approaches.

## Highlights

- Developed a vision-based agent for SuperTuxKart Ice Hockey using convolutional neural networks (UNet).
- Optimized controller strategy for effective gameplay, achieving competitive performance against state-based agents.

## Methodology

1. **Vision-Based Agent:** Utilized UNet architecture for accurate detection of puck and opponents from in-game images.
2. **Controller Strategy:** Designed hand-tuned strategy for agent's dynamic exploration and execution modes.

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy in detecting puck and opponents in game images.
- Improved agent's performance against state-based agents, demonstrating effective gameplay.

## Future Work

- Explore combining vision-based agent with reinforcement learning or end-to-end deep networks.
- Address limitations of camera viewpoint for better exploration.
